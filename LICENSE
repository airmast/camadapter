the Software as provided herein, solely for using the Software according with
its documentation (the "License").

additional user policies, rules or instructions which may be supplied with

agrees to comply with all such policies, rules or instructions and failure to do
so shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement.

1e. The Licensor reserves the right to amend the terms of the License given to
the End-User pursuant to this Agreement. Continued Use of the Software by
the End-User following the date of notification by the Licensor of the new terms

terms shall supersede the terms of the original License and shall thereafter
be deemed to be binding and enforceable.

no Undertaking and accepts no liability with respect to any thirds-party claims
in this respect. The provisions of this Clause shall survive the termination

Agreement.

The End-User is hereby notified and understands that most software products
contain programming errors ("Bugs") which may or may not be fixed or amended
and therefore, the Licensor makes no Undertaking that the Software licensed

at law, in custom or pursuant to industry standards, in this respect are
also excluded and waived in their entirety by the End-User and the Licensor
shall accept no liability towards the use of the Software or the completeness,
accuracy or reliability of any data or other results generated from the Software

any claims, disputes, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, costs
and expenses (including without limitation reasonable legal, court
and attorney's fees) made against or incurred by the Licensor arising out
of claims, suits or proceedings based on allegations alleging that the Use

consequential, direct or indirect damages, costs and expenses finally awarded

7. Limitation of Liability.

Notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary, the Licensor's
cumulative liability to you or any third party for any loss, cost or damage
resulting from any claims, demands, or actions arising out of or relating
to this Agreement shall not exceed the license fees actually paid
to the Licensor hereunder, if any. In no event shall the Licensor be liable
for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages
or lost profits, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility
of such damages.

the legislation of Latvia and the Courts of Republic of Latvia shall have

and/or unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity of the remainder
of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to
its terms. This Agreement does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply
an agency, partnership or other type of joint venture by and between
the parties. Any amendment to this Agreement shall be valid only and

of any failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement (or part thereof)
or any waiver of any obligation imposed under this Agreement shall be executed

of one clause or of any failure to comply shall not be deemed to create
any subsequent or similar waivers unless as stipulated by written and signed
agreement. The End-User may not assign its obligations and/or rights pursuant
